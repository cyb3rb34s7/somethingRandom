Since Use Of AI AND llm tools in increasing way too fast, there have been so many developments going on to Assist those tools like context7 MCP, playwright etc etc. Now There exists a lot of documentation that has already been Made for various tasks, like KT docs for enterprise teams, pictures And architecture diagrams, Policy docs, Developer docs etc etc. Now my question is they can be fed directly to AI and llms in some cases But Is there any tool That helps convert any Doc into AI usable format like .md or anything else, if not Or Not so popular Is there any real need or Saas opportunity for this purpose. Like do Big firms will need or do they need it currently as everyone is adopting AI don't they need help in transforming documentations, Is it a good opportunity or Is it just a Basic thought and can be solved with another Tool OR pdf s etc. Analyse this critically and go through all the sources available and tell me if There is a real need and market opportunity
