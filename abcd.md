Here is the refined version of Option 2. It incorporates your specific questions about the export feature while maintaining that "humble developer" vibe so you don't get banned.

This is ready to copy/paste.

**Title:**
Building a "Lifeboat" for Invoice Simple refugees: Is there already a tool that does this?

**Body:**
> Hey everyone,
>
> I’ve been reading a lot of frustration lately regarding the Invoice Simple price changes (and the new monthly limits). It seems like a lot of people want to switch to cheaper alternatives but feel stuck because their years of data are locked inside the app.
>
> I'm a developer looking for a weekend project, and I was thinking of building a simple "Migration Tool." Basically, a script that takes the messy Invoice Simple export file, cleans it up, and formats it so you can easily move your history to free/cheaper apps (or just Excel) without re-typing everything.
>
> **But before I start coding, I wanted to ask:**
>
> 1.  Has anyone here actually managed to export their data and move to another platform successfully?
> 2.  Is the standard CSV export they give you good enough to just plug into Wave/Zoho/Quickbooks?
> 3.  Does a tool like this already exist?
>
> I don't want to waste my weekend reinventing the wheel if there's already an easy way to get your data out. But if the export is useless and people are stuck, I’d be happy to build a simple fix for the community.
>
> Appreciate any insights!

1.  **r/smallbusiness** (Highest chance of replies)
2.  **r/entrepreneur**
3.  **r/sideproject** (You will get feedback from other devs here, which is good for technical validation)

**Tip:** If you get a reply saying "The CSV is a mess, I couldn't import it anywhere," **that is your green light.** That comment alone validates your entire business model.
