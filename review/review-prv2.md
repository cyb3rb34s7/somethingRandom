# PR Review Workflow - Codebase-Specific Perspective Analysis

You are conducting a comprehensive code review for a Pull Request. This review must be **specific to our codebase patterns**, not generic advice.

**CRITICAL:** Every comment MUST reference actual files, patterns, or examples from OUR codebase. Never give generic advice.

---

## Prerequisites Check

Before starting, verify:
- [ ] You have access to `gh` CLI (already authenticated)
- [ ] You are in the correct repository directory
- [ ] Context files exist in `.cline/context/`

If context files are missing, run `/build-context.md` first.

---

## STEP 1: Get PR Number from User

Ask the user which PR to review:

```xml
<ask_followup_question>
<question>Which PR number should I review?</question>
</ask_followup_question>
```

Wait for user response with PR number (e.g., "456" or "PR #456").

Extract the number and proceed with that PR.

---

## STEP 2: Fetch PR Information

Execute these commands to gather PR data:

```bash
# Get PR metadata
gh pr view {PR_NUMBER} --json title,body,author,comments,labels,additions,deletions

# Get the full diff
gh pr diff {PR_NUMBER}

# Get list of changed files
gh pr view {PR_NUMBER} --json files
```

**Action:** Read and understand:
- What is the PR trying to accomplish? (from title and body)
- What files are being changed?
- How large is the change? (additions/deletions)
- Are there any existing comments to consider?

---

## STEP 3: Load ALL Context Documentation

Read every context file to understand OUR patterns. This is CRITICAL - do not skip any file.

```xml
<read_file>
<path>.cline/context/architecture.md</path>
</read_file>

<read_file>
<path>.cline/context/java-springboot-patterns.md</path>
</read_file>

<read_file>
<path>.cline/context/mybatis-patterns.md</path>
</read_file>

<read_file>
<path>.cline/context/typescript-angular-patterns.md</path>
</read_file>

<read_file>
<path>.cline/context/anti-patterns.md</path>
</read_file>

<read_file>
<path>.cline/context/review-perspectives.md</path>
</read_file>
```

**Action:** Internalize these patterns. They define:
- HOW we write code
- WHAT patterns to follow
- WHAT mistakes to avoid
- WHAT to check in reviews

---

## STEP 4: Analyze Changed Files with Context

For EACH changed file, read it completely to understand the changes in context:

```xml
<read_file>
<path>{path_to_changed_file_1}</path>
</read_file>

<read_file>
<path>{path_to_changed_file_2}</path>
</read_file>

<!-- Repeat for ALL changed files -->
```

**For complex changes, also read related files:**

### If Java Controller changed:
```xml
<read_file>
<path>{related_service_file}</path>
</read_file>
```

### If Service changed:
```xml
<read_file>
<path>{related_repository_file}</path>
</read_file>
```

### If MyBatis XML changed:
```xml
<read_file>
<path>{corresponding_java_mapper_interface}</path>
</read_file>
```

### If Angular Component changed:
```xml
<read_file>
<path>{related_service_file}</path>
</read_file>
```

**Use search_files to find similar implementations:**

```xml
<search_files>
<path>src/</path>
<regex>{similar_method_name_or_pattern}</regex>
<file_pattern>*.java</file_pattern>
</search_files>
```

---

## STEP 5: Perform Perspective-Based Analysis

Now analyze the PR changes against OUR codebase patterns. Work through EACH perspective systematically.

**IMPORTANT:** Only report issues you actually find. Don't invent issues. If a perspective has no issues, say so.

### üß† [Logical] Analysis - TOP PRIORITY

Reference: `.cline/context/review-perspectives.md` - Logical section

**For Java/Spring Boot changes, check:**
1. **Null/Optional handling** - Compare with our Optional patterns in `java-springboot-patterns.md`
2. **Collection operations** - Are loops/streams correct? Off-by-one errors?
3. **Conditional logic** - Are all branches handled?
4. **Transaction boundaries** - Is @Transactional used correctly per our pattern?

**For MyBatis changes, check:**
1. **Query logic** - Are WHERE clauses, JOINs correct?
2. **Dynamic SQL** - Is the logic sound? Compare with examples in `mybatis-patterns.md`
3. **Parameter handling** - What if parameters are null?

**For TypeScript/Angular changes, check:**
1. **Observable logic** - Are RxJS operators correct? Compare with our patterns
2. **Type safety** - Could undefined/null slip through?
3. **Form logic** - Are all states handled?

**Record findings with:**
- Specific line numbers
- What's wrong and why (based on OUR patterns)
- Reference to similar code in our codebase
- Concrete fix suggestion

---

### üí° [Improvement] Analysis - HIGH PRIORITY

Reference: `.cline/context/review-perspectives.md` - Improvement section

**Question for each change:** "Is there a BETTER way we already do this in OUR codebase?"

**For Java/Spring Boot:**
1. **Could this use existing utility classes?** (Check `java-springboot-patterns.md` - Common Utilities section)
2. **Does response format match other controllers?** (Compare with example controllers in patterns file)
3. **Is this duplicating code?** (Search for similar implementations)
4. **Does exception handling match our pattern?** (Check exception handling section)

**For MyBatis:**
1. **Could query be more efficient?** (Compare with similar queries in `mybatis-patterns.md`)
2. **Should this use our pagination pattern?** (Check pagination section)
3. **Could this reuse existing resultMap?** (Search for similar mappings)

**For TypeScript/Angular:**
1. **Could this use existing service?** (Check `typescript-angular-patterns.md` - Services section)
2. **Should this follow our component structure?** (Compare with example components)
3. **Does observable pattern match ours?** (Check RxJS patterns section)

**For each improvement, provide:**
- What they currently did
- The better way from OUR codebase (with file reference)
- Why our way is better in our context
- Code example from our codebase

---

### üîß [Maintenance] Analysis - MEDIUM PRIORITY

Reference: `.cline/context/review-perspectives.md` - Maintenance section

**Check:**
1. **Naming conventions** - Compare with our conventions in pattern files
2. **Code organization** - Is structure similar to related files?
3. **Documentation** - Is complex logic explained?
4. **Magic numbers/strings** - Should these be constants? (Check our constant patterns)
5. **Method length** - Compare with typical method lengths in our codebase
6. **Architectural consistency** - Does this respect module boundaries from `architecture.md`?

---

### üêõ [Bug] Analysis - HIGH PRIORITY

Reference: `.cline/context/review-perspectives.md` - Bug section
Reference: `.cline/context/anti-patterns.md` - Past bugs and issues

**CRITICAL: Check against past bugs in anti-patterns.md**

**For Java/Spring Boot:**
1. **Exception handling** - Could uncaught exceptions occur? (Check our exception patterns)
2. **NPE potential** - Could this be null? (Check past NPE incidents in anti-patterns.md)
3. **Transaction rollback** - Is rollback handled correctly?
4. **Resource leaks** - Are resources closed?

**For MyBatis:**
1. **SQL errors** - Could query fail with certain data?
2. **${} usage** - SQL INJECTION RISK! (Check anti-patterns.md)
3. **Type mismatches** - Java types match database types?

**For TypeScript/Angular:**
1. **Undefined errors** - Could properties be undefined?
2. **Subscription leaks** - Is unsubscribe handled? (Check our subscription patterns)
3. **Race conditions** - Are async operations safe?

**For each bug, reference:**
- Similar past incidents from anti-patterns.md if exists
- How we prevent this elsewhere in codebase
- Specific scenario where bug would occur

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è [Critical] Analysis - HIGHEST PRIORITY

Reference: `.cline/context/review-perspectives.md` - Critical section
Reference: `.cline/context/anti-patterns.md` - Security and critical issues

**MUST CHECK (Non-negotiable):**

**Security:**
1. **SQL Injection** - ANY ${} in MyBatis XML? (Check EVERY changed mapper)
2. **Input validation** - Is user input validated per our pattern?
3. **Sensitive data** - Is sensitive data logged or exposed?
4. **Hardcoded credentials** - Any credentials in code?

**Data Loss:**
1. **Delete operations** - Is deletion safe? Should be soft delete?
2. **Update without WHERE** - Could this update wrong records?
3. **Transaction issues** - Could partial data be committed?

**Performance:**
1. **N+1 queries** - Loops with DB calls inside? (Check anti-patterns.md examples)
2. **Missing pagination** - Large datasets without pagination?
3. **Infinite loops** - Could loops run forever?

**Breaking Changes:**
1. **API changes** - Does this break existing contracts?
2. **Database schema** - Are migrations included?

**If any critical issue found, this is a MUST FIX before merge.**

## Important Guidelines

### DO:
‚úÖ Reference ACTUAL files from our codebase
‚úÖ Compare with EXISTING implementations in our code
‚úÖ Point to SPECIFIC patterns in context files
‚úÖ Reference past incidents from anti-patterns.md
‚úÖ Use "we" language ("In our codebase, we...")
‚úÖ Be constructive and educational
‚úÖ Provide code examples from OUR codebase
‚úÖ Only report issues that ACTUALLY exist

### DON'T:
‚ùå Give generic advice ("follow best practices")
‚ùå Invent patterns that don't exist
‚ùå Reference files that don't exist
‚ùå Copy/paste from context files without adaptation
‚ùå Use "you should" language
‚ùå Ignore the context files
‚ùå Skip reading changed files completely
‚ùå Invent issues when code is fine

### Tone:
- Friendly and collaborative
- Educational, not judgmental
- "We" not "you"
- Assume good intent
- Frame as learning opportunity
- Praise good patterns

---

## Error Handling

### If gh commands fail:
```bash
# Verify PR exists
gh pr view {PR_NUMBER} --json number

# If unauthorized
echo "Error: Not authenticated with GitHub. Please run: gh auth login"

# If PR not found
echo "Error: PR #{PR_NUMBER} not found in this repository"
```

### If context files missing:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è **Context files not found!**

I cannot perform a codebase-specific review without context files.

Please run `/build-context.md` first to generate:
- architecture.md
- java-springboot-patterns.md
- mybatis-patterns.md
- typescript-angular-patterns.md
- anti-patterns.md
- review-perspectives.md

After context files are generated, run this workflow again.
```

### If changed files cannot be read:
```bash
# Try alternative path
find . -name "{filename}" | head -1
```

2. **Compare side-by-side** - Open similar files and compare
3. **Search for examples** - Use search_files to find similar implementations
4. **Check anti-patterns** - Always reference past bugs
5. **Be specific** - Line numbers, file paths, exact issues
6. **Provide solutions** - Not just problems, but how we solve them
7. **Keep learning** - Note patterns to add to context files
