Below is a “super prompt” you can feed into your UI mockup tool (e.g., Figma plugin, Visily, Uizard, or any AI-driven mockup generator). It lays out a modern, engaging, and feature-rich interface for your AI-powered India–Pakistan tension tracker, complete with mock data placeholders.

Super Prompt for UI Mockup Generation

> Context:
You are designing a progressive web app (PWA) called “TrueSight”—an AI-driven news and verification platform for live India–Pakistan developments. The UI should feel modern, clean, and immersive, blending minimalism with subtle depth and motion. It should keep users engaged through data storytelling, personalized feeds, gamified community contributions, and real-time alerts.

Design Guidelines:

Big Typography & Bold Visuals: Use oversized headlines and clear, high-contrast text to guide focus on critical updates .

Neumorphism 2.0 Accents: Incorporate soft shadows and layered card components for depth, especially in the key info panels .

3D & Motion Graphics: Add subtle 3D elements (e.g., rotating map pins) and micro-animations when new data loads .

Low-Light Mode: Provide a “Calm Dark” theme with low contrast for night-time reading .

AI-Driven Personalization: Highlight user-specific “My Watchlist” trends and source recommendations .


Mock Data Conventions:

Use country flags (🇮🇳, 🇵🇰) and timestamped headlines (e.g., “2 min ago”).

Display credibility scores as colored badges (e.g., ★★★★☆).

Community points, badges, and progress bars labeled “Fact-Hero Level 3” with “1,250 pts” .
