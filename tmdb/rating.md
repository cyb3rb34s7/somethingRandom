Got it — you want each competency’s rationale to sound more personal and grounded in real actions, not abstract praise. I’ll now restructure everything into bullet points, weave in your actual projects, and still keep it clear, human, and concise — like you're just explaining casually but confidently to your team lead.


---

✅ Innovation

Proposed and implemented consistent hashing to scale a different module — even though it wasn’t mine — and handled routing complexities.

Introduced multiplexing support in our backend, something totally new to the system, which allowed smoother multi-request processing.

Constantly explore and share new tech with the team — from LangGraph and n8n to practical GenAI use cases.

Designed a GenAI-powered agent demo and gave a session on agentic AI to introduce new thinking across teams.



---

✅ Problem Solving

Identified multiplexing bottleneck on my own during export work — took time to research and solve it when others weren’t sure what was wrong.

Solved pagination and load time issues by adding lazy loading and click-based data fetch, improving page speed from 20s to under 3s.

Delivered Bingeplus portal in just one day by using GenAI tools smartly to speed up design and development without cutting corners.



---

✅ Team

Took up scaling work for a different module when no one else volunteered, and saw it through end-to-end.

Regularly help my teammates with DB optimization, writing frontend components, and resolving blockers.

Contributed to Bingeplus (a separate project team) for both frontend and data pipeline work during crunch time without being asked.

Mentor interns and guide them with tools, coding patterns, and current tech trends to help them grow.



---

✅ Ownership

Delivered the entire Bingeplus portal frontend and backend in a day — fully functional, fast, and praised for design quality.

Worked late nights and weekends to support Bingeplus demo timelines and help the data team push things across the finish line.

Built out history management with full test coverage, and kept adapting it based on feedback and new IXD changes.



---

✅ Decision Making

Compared multiple designs and approaches before choosing consistent hashing and multiplexing based on long-term scale and maintainability.

Used GenAI tools (Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT) to simulate different solutions and refine ideas before writing actual code.

Picked multithreading for the export upgrade task after evaluating system load, export complexity, and delivery timelines.



---

✅ Continuous Learning

Built full apps in React and wrote backend scripts in Python, stepping outside my main stack (Java + Angular) when needed.

Learned how to build agentic systems, practiced prompt engineering, and explored automation tools to increase daily workflow efficiency.

Keep experimenting with frameworks like LangGraph to bring value beyond just daily sprint work.



---

✅ Deliverables

Consistently deliver quality code with 90%+ test coverage — like the full history module.

Took feedback from my team lead and improved asset loading strategy to reduce system lag.

Upgraded the export module to handle 200K+ assets efficiently with batching and multithreading to keep UX smooth and system stable.



---

✅ Global Collaboration

Collaborated with Bingeplus team (a completely different org unit) and contributed both on React frontend and Python backend.

Active member of the Org-level AI Coding TF — evaluating AI dev tools (Cursor, Claude, Windsurf) with engineers across teams.

Coordinated and gave a session on agentic AI with folks from multiple projects and helped drive cross-team awareness.



---

✅ Collaboration & Risk Management

Flagged memory and container load risks early during export upgrade work, and built a fix to avoid overwhelming the system.

Suggested alternative designs when facing system limits — like shifting to multi-threaded export processing.

Keep a habit of checking performance impact and fallback plans before rolling out anything large.



---

✅ Communication

Share helpful tools, updates, and tech concepts with my team regularly in a simple, easy-to-understand way.

Help onboard new interns and guide them patiently, tailoring explanations depending on their background.

Presented a session on agentic systems clearly to teammates from different backgrounds, making sure everyone could relate.

Let me know if you'd like this adapted into a form or slide or need help with the self-ratings too. I can also write a summary paragraph for each section if your submission format needs it.
