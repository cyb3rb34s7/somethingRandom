Here is the technical breakdown of the method Amazon is using to build AI Video Recaps, formatted so you can directly paste it into a post.

### **The Method: How Prime Video Generative AI Recaps Work**

Amazon's "Video Recap" engine isn't a single AI model; it is a multi-stage pipeline running on AWS that functions like an automated video editor. Here is the step-by-step technical process:

**1. Multimodal Ingestion (The "Eyes and Ears")**
The system first treats the TV show episodes as a massive dataset. It runs parallel analysis on three distinct layers using **Amazon SageMaker** custom models:
* **Visual Analysis:** It scans the video specifically for "shot changes," key characters, and location settings.
* **Audio Analysis:** It identifies dialogue segments, silence, and background music (to detect emotional tone, e.g., "tense," "action," or "melancholy").
* **Text Analysis:** It ingests subtitles and metadata to understand the literal plot progression.

**2. Narrative Extraction (The "Brain")**
The core logic is powered by **Amazon Bedrock**, which provides access to large language models (LLMs). The AI is prompted to look at the data from Step 1 and identify "pivotal moments" and "character arcs" relevant to the upcoming season. It filters out filler scenes and focuses only on narrative beats necessary for context.

**3. Safety & Anti-Spoiler Guardrails**
Before any content is selected, the system runs through **Amazon Bedrock Guardrails**. This is a crucial filtering layer that strictly limits the AI's knowledge scope. If a user is on Season 3 Episode 4, the Guardrails prevent the model from referencing or selecting clips from Episode 5 onwards, ensuring the recap is "context-aware" and spoiler-free.

**4. Asset Retrieval & Alignment**
Once the "script" of the recap is generated by the LLM, the system performs a reverse-lookup. It pairs the generated text summary with the exact video timecodes (timestamps) identified in Step 1. It selects the best quality clips that match the script visually.

**5. Generative Assembly (The "Editor")**
The final stage is the "stitching" process. The system:
* Generates a synthetic voiceover (using text-to-speech) to narrate the script.
* Overlays the selected video clips.
* Mixes in the original background score and dialogue snippets (audio ducking) to give it a "theatrical" feel rather than a robotic slideshow.
